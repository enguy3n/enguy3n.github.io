                    GreenChallenge was created as a final project for CSCI 3308: Software Development and Tools at CU Boulder.
                    It is a social media application where users could log activities to measure their carbon emissions and compete against other users to have a more positive footprint
                    on the environment.  
                    I was responsible for UI and graphics of the application, alongside creating several site protocols.  
                    I also spent much of my time on the project helping others manage Git and debug their code, alongside helping the team manage deadlines and meetings.

                    Freyja Simulator is a retelling of Hyndluljóð, an old Norse poem, with some added story,
                    made partially as a challenge to myself to create an application in a single night, including writing its story, designing its UI, and programming all its functionality,
                    though minor typo fixes were made in the following days.  
                    Its functional design was inspired by text-based games, with its appearance made simple to focus the text.

                    This poster was created for ATLS 2300: Text at CU Boulder.   
                    The assignment was to create a poster mailer for the Colorado Symphony's 2023 <em>Classics</em> season performances, using a given set of text.  
                    The assignment included the additional constraints that only 2 fonts of a given set of fonts could be used, only pantone colors could be used, and the poster had to be a certain size.  
                    Given constraints, this was an exercise in working with client-specified constraints while managing to effectively display information anyway.

                    This poster was created for ATLS 2300: Text at CU Boulder.  
                    The assignment was to pick a font with multiple styles (bold, italic, condensed) and display them in some way in the poster.
                    The goal was to highlight the glyphs themselves through effective arrangement of text, as opposed to distracting
                    a viewer with graphics.
