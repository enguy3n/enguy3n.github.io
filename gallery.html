                    GreenChallenge was created as a final project for CSCI 3308: Software Development and Tools at CU Boulder.
                    It is a social media application where users could log activities to measure their carbon emissions and compete against other users to have a more positive footprint
                    on the environment.  
                    I was responsible for UI and graphics of the application, alongside creating several site protocols.  
                    I also spent much of my time on the project helping others manage Git and debug their code, alongside helping the team manage deadlines and meetings.

                    Freyja Simulator is a retelling of Hyndluljóð, an old Norse poem, with some added story,
                    made partially as a challenge to myself to create an application in a single night, including writing its story, designing its UI, and programming all its functionality,
                    though minor typo fixes were made in the following days.  
                    Its functional design was inspired by text-based games, with its appearance made simple to focus the text.

                    I created a mini pixel art creator as a final project in ATLS 2200: Web, a class at CU Boulder that focused on basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
                    The application includes a wide variety of features, including custom color picking, an eyedropper tool, color saving, and dark/light mode.
