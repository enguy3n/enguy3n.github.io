                        A mockup flyer created for ATLS2300: Text, a class at CU Boulder. The assignment was to create 
                        a flyer that included text provided by the Colorado Symphony for their 2023/24 
                        Classics season. The assignment was limited: you could only use four or less Pantone colors, had 
                        to make the poster a certain size, and were only allowed to use graphics if they were symbols, so 
                        the goal was to make a visually appealing poster (focusing on typography) while including all 
                        required text.
