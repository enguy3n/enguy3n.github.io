                My name is Ethan Nguyen, and I am currently a third-year student at the University of Colorado Boulder
                seeking a bachelor of science in Computer Science. I am minoring in
                <a href = "https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/academics/undergraduate/ctd-minor">Creative Technology and Design</a>,
                focusing on designing for appeal to audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                My computer science work, both academically and extracurricularly, includes creating terminal programs
                for tasks ranging from basic computation to accessing APIs for data processing. I also have created web-based
                applications such as a rudimentary pixel art creator and a star movement simulator using tools such as Javascript,
                NodeJS, and Flask. I love the process of creating applications, from designing for aesthetics and functionality,
                to programming finalized products. I have also done minor experimentation in data science and data processing, as well
                as working with microcontrollers for electrical/mechanical systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a graphic designer, I like to design posters, applications, and more. I am fascinated by the study of how colors,
                text placement, font choices, and telegraphy can be used to guide audiences' experience, from how they read text, to
                what emotions they should feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my freetime, I like to spend time hiking, learning to cook/bake, and improving my illustrative skills.
                I love to learn and expand my skills, and believe that doing this not only makes me stronger in what I am learning,
                but also in finding new knowledge to apply in other fields.
