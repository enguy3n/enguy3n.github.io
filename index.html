                Hello, my name is Ethan Nguyen. 
                I am a computer scientist student with an interest in full-stack development and other ways of building 
                applications, from designing them, to shipping a finished product.
                I also have an interest in graphic design and presenting information in appealing ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find my work on this website.
