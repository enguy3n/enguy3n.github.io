        <p>Hello, my name is Ethan Nguyen.  I'm a CS major and CTD minor.</p>
        <p>A lot of why I took this course is I'm interested in extending my abilities to work with computers.  I'm especially intersted in learning how I could potentially create websites for my own purpose, or to help others.  I'm also just curious.</p>
        <p>I'm a 19-year-old sophomore.  I don't have a lot of hobbies but I enjoy gaming a bit, drawing, and spending time in the mountains.  I also like dinosaurs.</p>
