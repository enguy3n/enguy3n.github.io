                The following is a collection of programming projects I have worked on, both for academics 
                and extracurriculars. Most of them contain a link to the working application, but some are not 
                actually hosted anywhere and therefore cannot be accessed any other way than recording.

                        GreenChallenge was a mock website created for CSCI 3308: Software Development and Tools,
                        a class at CU Boulder, and was a team effort.

                        I was responsible for login, register, about, and user profile pages entirely (layout, database 
                        access/manipulation), and did UI design/coding for the entire website. I also managed team deadlines, 
                        meetings, and coordinated people, alongside being on standby to help troubleshoot problems and teach 
                        others how to use certain tools.

                        Freyja Simulator is a text adventure adaptation of Hyndluljóð, an Old Norse poem. 
                        It was designed, planned, and programmed in a single night, and is somewhat
                        buggy as a result. Despite this, it was a good exercise in rapidly developing something, 
                        which challenged the limits of my knowledge in Javascript.

                        This pixel art creator was my final project for ATLS2200: Web, a class at CU Boulder 
                        which primarily focused on HTML and CSS. This project was challenging because it 
                        was my first time working with Javascript to the degree of depth this project required. 
                        It includes a fixed-size canvas (where lines can be hidden), color selection (via a fixed 
                        palette, RGB sliders, or an eyedropper), eraser/canvas clearing, and a color history.
