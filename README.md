## Ethan Nguyen - He/Him
![portrait of self](./img/picture.png)

Hello, my name is Ethan Nguyen.  I'm a CS major and CTD minor.

A lot of why I took this course is I'm interested in extending my abilities to work with computers.  I'm especially intersted in learning how I could potentially create websites for my own purpose, or to help others.  I'm also just curious.

I'm a 19-year-old sophomore.  I don't have a lot of hobbies but I enjoy gaming a bit, drawing, and spending time in the mountains.  I also like dinosaurs.
